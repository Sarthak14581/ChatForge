# ChatForge

ChatForge is a full-stack AI chat application built using the **MERN stack** that allows users to interact with an AI assistant in real time. The system manages conversations using thread-based storage, maintains conversational context using sliding window techniques, and implements secure authentication using JWT access and refresh tokens.

This project demonstrates **secure backend architecture, scalable chat storage, efficient AI context management, and production-ready deployment practices.**

## Architecture Overview
React (Vite Frontend)
|
| HTTPS Requests
|
Node.js / Express Backend
|
| REST APIs
|
MongoDB Atlas
|
| AI Request Proxy
|
OpenAI API (gpt-4o-mini)


The backend acts as a **secure proxy** between the frontend and the OpenAI API.  
This prevents exposure of API keys and enables server-side control of AI requests.

## Authentication Architecture

ChatForge implements a **secure authentication system using access and refresh tokens.**

### Access Token

- Short-lived (~5–15 minutes)
- Stored in **HTTP-only cookie**
- Automatically sent with API requests
- Used for authenticating protected routes

### Refresh Token

- Longer lifetime (~4 hours)
- Stored in **HTTP-only cookie**
- Used to generate new access tokens

Each refresh token contains a **unique tokenId** which enables:

- session tracking
- session revocation
- multiple device login support

---

## Refresh Token Flow

1. Client sends request to protected API
2. If access token expired → server returns **401**
3. Frontend attempts token refresh using `/refresh`
4. If refresh token is valid → new access token issued
5. Original request is retried automatically

This process is handled by a custom React hook.

---

## Custom Auth Fetch Hook

Frontend uses a custom hook:

useAuthenticatedFetch()

Flow:

1. Send request to protected endpoint
2. If response status is **401**
3. Attempt refresh using `/refresh`
4. Retry original request
5. If refresh fails → logout user

This enables **silent authentication refresh without interrupting the user experience.**

---

## Chat System Architecture

Chats are organized as **threads**.

### User Schema
User
├── id
├── email
├── password
├── refreshTokens[]
└── chats[{ threadId }]


### Thread Schema
Thread
├── threadId
├── title
├── messages[]
├── summary
├── summarizedUntil
├── createdAt
└── updatedAt


### Message Structure
{
role: "user" | "assistant",
content: String,
timestamp: Date
}


Thread data is stored separately to avoid redundancy and improve scalability.

---

## Conversation Context Handling

OpenAI APIs are **stateless**, meaning they do not remember previous messages.  
ChatForge manages context manually using two techniques.

### Sliding Window Context

Only the most recent messages are sent to the model.

Example:
thread.messages.slice(-N)


This prevents excessive token usage and keeps responses fast.

---

### Incremental Summarization

For long conversations, older messages are summarized.

Thread fields used:
summary
summarizedUntil

Logic:

1. Detect unsummarized messages
2. Summarize older messages
3. Append summary to existing summary
4. Send summary + recent messages to the model

This allows **long conversations without exceeding token limits.**

---

## Chat Title Generation

The first user message is used to generate a thread title.

AI prompt constraints:

- maximum **6 words**
- no punctuation
- title only

This produces clean titles for the sidebar chat list.

---

### Frontend Setup
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev


---

## Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the backend directory.

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

Deployed on **Vercel**
https://vercel.com

### Backend

Deployed on **Render**
https://render.com


### Database

https://mongodb.com/atlas


---

## Preventing Render Cold Start

Render free tier instances go to sleep after inactivity.

To keep the backend active, a health endpoint is implemented.

GET /api/health

This endpoint is pinged every few minutes using **UptimeRobot** to prevent server sleep.

---

## Future Improvements

Planned improvements include:

- Streaming AI responses
- Message editing and regeneration
- Chat export functionality
- Message virtualization for performance
- Token usage tracking
- Rate limiting
- Improved mobile UI
